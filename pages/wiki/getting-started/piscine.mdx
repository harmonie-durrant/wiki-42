# üèä Piscine

## What is the piscine ?

The "piscine" is a term used by 42school to refer to their intensive coding program. It is a French word that translates to "swimming pool" in English. The idea behind the piscine is that participants are immersed in a challenging coding environment for a set period of time, typically several weeks. During this time, students are expected to work on coding projects and exercises for long hours, including weekends.

The piscine is designed to be a highly immersive and intense experience, where participants are encouraged to learn and solve problems independently. It aims to develop strong coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and a deep understanding of programming concepts.

At 42school, the piscine is used as a selection process for their main program. It allows the school to assess the motivation and dedication, of the participants. Successful completion of the piscine can lead to admission into the full-time program at 42school.

Overall, the piscine is a unique and challenging coding experience that pushes participants to their limits and helps them develop the skills necessary for a successful career in software development.

## What is a Rush ?

In the context of 42school, a "rush" refers to a specific type of coding project or challenge. It is a collaborative coding exercise where students work together in teams to develop a software project within a limited timeframe.

During a rush, students are given a specific theme or problem to solve, and they must come up with a creative and functional solution. The goal of a rush is not only to build a working software application but also to foster teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills.

Rushes are typically intense and fast-paced, with teams working under time pressure to deliver a working prototype or solution. They are designed to simulate real-world scenarios where developers need to work together efficiently to meet deadlines and produce high-quality code.

At 42school, rushes are an integral part of the learning experience. They provide students with an opportunity to apply their coding skills in a practical setting, collaborate with their peers, and gain hands-on experience in software development. Rushes also help students develop important soft skills such as project management, teamwork, and effective communication.

Overall, rushes at 42school are challenging yet rewarding experiences that contribute to the holistic development of students as software developers.

## What are exams ?

At 42school, "exams" are a form of assessment used to evaluate students' understanding and application of the coding concepts they have learned. They are typically timed tests where students are required to solve a series of programming problems.

Here's how they generally work:

- **Duration and Format:**
Exams usually last several hours and consist of multiple coding problems. The problems can range from simple tasks to complex algorithmic challenges. The difficulty level often increases as the exam progresses.

- **Environment:**
Exams are usually taken in a controlled environment, often at the school's premises. Students are expected to work individually and are not allowed to collaborate or use external resources unless explicitly permitted.

- **Evaluation:**
The solutions submitted by students are evaluated based on their correctness, efficiency, and adherence to coding standards. Automated testing tools are often used to check the functionality of the code.

- **Purpose:**
The main purpose of these exams is to assess students' problem-solving skills, their understanding of programming.
