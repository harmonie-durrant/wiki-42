During the check-in process, you will be given a presentation of 42school, the piscine and the campus. You will also be given a tour of the campus and the facilities available to you.
The check-in process is a great opportunity to get a feel for the school and the environment you will be studying in. It is also a chance to ask any questions you may have about the piscine and the program.

While the check-in process is not obligatory, it is highly recommended that you attend as it will help you prepare for the piscine and give you a better understanding of what to expect.

The online check takes place online on the admission page a few weeks before the Piscine starts. Then, you will have to proceed with the ID check, on site, a few days before the Piscine.
The check-id process is the process of confirming your presence for the piscine. You will need to provide your ID and other necessary documents to verify your identity and complete the registration process.
