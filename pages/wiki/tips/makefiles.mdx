# ðŸ“¦ Makefiles

## Introduction

A Makefile is a file, read by the `Make` program, which executes all the commands and rules in the Makefile.

At 42, you will use Makefiles to compile your projects. Here are some tips to help you write better Makefiles.

## Generic Makefile

A simple Makefile is composed of your project source files (the .c files) and some rules to make your Make command work.

You have to list your source files like this:

```make
SRCS = main.c \
       utils.c \
       ...
```

After that, you can use them to build your objects. It will take all .c files in $(SRC) and compile them into .o files.

```make
OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)
```

Then, you can compile your objects into a binary file.
note: the rule "all" is used to tell the make program what rule is used by default.

```make
NAME = my_program

$(NAME): $(OBJS)
    gcc $(OBJS) -o $(NAME)

all:     $(NAME)
```

Finally, you can add some rules to clean your project.

```make
clean:
    rm -f $(OBJS)

fclean: clean
    rm -f $(NAME)
```

optionally, you can add a rule to recompile your project. This will remove the .o files and the binary and recompile them.

```make
re: fclean $(NAME)
```

Comments in a Makefile are written with a `#` symbol.

```make
# This is a comment and will not be run by the Make program
echo "This line will be run by the Make program"
```

Here is the full Makefile:

```make
NAME = my_program

SRCS = main.c \
       utils.c

OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)

$(NAME): $(OBJS)
    gcc $(OBJS) -o $(NAME)

clean:
    rm -f $(OBJS)

fclean: clean
    rm -f $(NAME)

re: fclean $(NAME)

all:     $(NAME)
```

## Advanced Makefile

If you want to go further, you can add some flags to your Makefile. In the following example, we make some variables for the compiler and the flags.

```make
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -Werror
```

You can also add some rules to compile your objects with the flags.

```make
$(NAME): $(OBJS)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) -o $(NAME)
```

Here is the full Makefile:

```make
NAME = my_program

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -Werror

SRCS = main.c \
       utils.c

OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)

$(NAME): $(OBJS)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) -o $(NAME)

clean:
    rm -f $(OBJS)

fclean: clean

re: fclean $(NAME)

all:     $(NAME)
```
